# Introduction

This is the documentation for this code base. It offers guidance to help any developer understand the decisions that have gone into the code.

## Firebase.js

This file does the following:

- Initializes firebase for the backend
- firebaseConfig stores all the project information for this project as given by fire base.
- The exported variable firebaseApp is an instance of the initialization, and is to be used in other parts of the code base where firebase features are needed.
  - The initialization takes a paramerter of firebaseConfig

## Authentication

### Signup.js

This code defines a signup form for a React application. Here's how it works:

User Input: The user enters their name, email, and password in designated text fields.

Sign Up with Firebase: Upon submitting the form, the handleSubmit function is triggered. It uses Firebase's createUserWithEmailAndPassword to create a new user account with the provided email and password.

Data Handling: If successful, the function creates a userData object containing the user's name, email, and a unique ID assigned by Firebase. This data is then stored in the component's state using setData.

Navigation: If there are no errors, the user is redirected to the "/onboarding/business-details" route using navigate.

Firestore Integration (Commented Out): The code includes commented-out logic for adding the user data to Firestore, a NoSQL database from Firebase. It demonstrates how to create a document within the "users" collection and set the user data as fields within that document.

Overall, this React component allows users to sign up with email and password using Firebase Authentication and prepares the user data for potential storage in Firestore.

### Login.js

THis file contains a React component that implements the firebase email and password login.
