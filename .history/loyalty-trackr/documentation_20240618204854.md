# Introduction

This is the documentation for this code base. It offers guidance to help any developer understand the decisions that have gone into the code.

## Firebase.js

This file does the following:

- Initializes firebase for the backend
- firebaseConfig stores all the project information for this project as given by fire base.
- The exported variable firebaseApp is an instance of the initialization, and is to be used in other parts of the code base where firebase features are needed.
  - The initialization takes a paramerter of firebaseConfig

## Authentication module

### Signup.js

This code defines a signup form for a React application. Here's how it works:

User Input: The user enters their name, email, and password in designated text fields.

Sign Up with Firebase: Upon submitting the form, the handleSubmit function is triggered. It uses Firebase's createUserWithEmailAndPassword to create a new user account with the provided email and password.

Data Handling: If successful, the function creates a userData object containing the user's name, email, and a unique ID assigned by Firebase. This data is then stored in the component's state using setData.

Navigation: If there are no errors, the user is redirected to the "/onboarding/business-details" route using navigate.

Firestore Integration (Commented Out): The code includes commented-out logic for adding the user data to Firestore, a NoSQL database from Firebase. It demonstrates how to create a document within the "users" collection and set the user data as fields within that document.

Overall, this React component allows users to sign up with email and password using Firebase Authentication and prepares the user data for potential storage in Firestore.

### Login.js

Functionality: This React component renders a login form.

User Input: The user enters their email and password in designated text fields.

Sign In with Firebase: Clicking the "Login" button triggers the handleSubmit function. It uses Firebase's signInWithEmailAndPassword to authenticate the user with the provided email and password.

Success and Navigation: Upon successful login, the user data (userCredential) is retrieved. However, the code doesn't explicitly use this data in this snippet (represented by the comment "// ..."). It then redirects the user to the "/onboarding/business-details" route using navigate.

Error Handling: If there's an error during sign-in, the code logs the error code and message for debugging purposes.

Overall, this React component facilitates user login with email and password using Firebase Authentication and redirects them to a specific route upon successful login.

## Onboarding module

### onboardingStore.js

This code defines a Zustand store specifically for onboarding purposes within a React application. Let's break down what it does:

1. **Store Creation:** The `create` function from Zustand is used to create a new store named `onBoardingStore`.

2. **Slices of State:** The store manages various slices of onboarding data using state and setters:

   - `user`: Stores user information (likely populated during signup).
     - `storeUser`: Function to update the `user` state with new user data.
   - `businessDetails`: Stores business details (likely from the BusinessDetails component).
     - `storeBusinessDetails`: Function to update the `businessDetails` state.
   - `pointsPerPurchase`: Stores points awarded per purchase configuration (potentially for a loyalty program).
     - `storePointsPerPurchase`: Function to update the `pointsPerPurchase` state.
   - `redemptionOptions`: Stores an array of options for redeeming points (potentially rewards in a loyalty program).
     - `storeRedemptionOptions`: Function to add a new redemption option to the `redemptionOptions` state array.
   - `conditions`: Stores conditions related to onboarding (purpose not entirely clear from this snippet).
     - `storeConditions`: Function to update the `conditions` state.

3. **Updating State:** Each setter function updates the corresponding slice of state within the store. For example, `storeUser(newUser)` would update the `user` state with the provided `newUser` data.

**Overall, this Zustand store provides a centralized location to manage various data aspects during the user onboarding process of a React application.**

### BusinessDetails.js

This code defines a form for users to enter their business details during an onboarding process. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Component State:** It manages the business name (`name`) and chosen industry (`industry`) using React's `useState` hook. There's also a state variable for `businessDetails` but it's not used in the provided code snippet.

2. **Data Fetching (Commented Out):** There's commented-out code for `updateBusinessDetails` that retrieves a document reference likely representing the user's business details within Firestore. This suggests potential integration with a Firestore database but it's not implemented in this specific code.

3. **User Input:** The form includes sections for the user to enter their business name and select an industry from a dropdown menu populated with the provided `industryList`.

4. **Local Storage:** The `storeBusinessDetails` function, connected to the onboarding store using `onBoardingStore`, stores the entered business details (`businessName` and `businessCategory`) in the local storage of the application.

5. **Form Submission:** Clicking the "Next" button triggers the `storeDetails` function. It creates a `details` object with the business name and category, and then stores it using the `storeBusinessDetails` function.

**In essence, this React component captures business name and industry selection from the user and stores them in the zustand onboarding store.**
